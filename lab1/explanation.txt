Hello, there. I know it's too much work for you to tailor the autogravder to someone who is getting a free course so no frustration from me. In fact, only thanks. Thanks for having this autograder up for someone like me. Good thing I was looking for the final before I took the midterm because I found the autogravder in the announcements. Maybe if I had read the autograder tab, I could have found it from the beginning. But woe, I found it now, and now I go back to submit all the things I never submitted and see if in fact, I had been doing things correctly. Thank you again!
